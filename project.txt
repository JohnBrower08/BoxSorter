Conceptual Design

The system consists of:

    A conveyor belt with sensors to detect when a box is present.
    A barcode scanner to read package information.
    A sorting mechanism (e.g., actuators or diverters) to direct packages to the appropriate bins.
    Four bins for sorting: Bin 1, Bin 2, Bin 3, and the Reject Bin.
    A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to control the system.

Flowchart

Hereâ€™s a flowchart detailing the operation:

    Start.
    Conveyor moves boxes forward.
    Sensor detects a box:
        Stop the conveyor.
        Read the barcode.
    Parse barcode:
        Validate package dimensions and weight.
        Extract package ID and sort location.
    Validate the package:
        If dimensions or weight are out of range, send to the Reject Bin.
        If valid, sort based on the sort location code.
    Log the package ID and destination.
    Resume conveyor movement.
    Repeat until all boxes are sorted.

Basic Components
Mechanical:

    Conveyor belt: For transporting boxes.
    Diverters: For directing boxes to bins.
    Four bins: For sorted and rejected boxes.

Sensors and Electronics:

    IR or Ultrasonic sensor: For detecting when a box blocks the sensor.
    Barcode scanner: To read Code128 barcodes.
    Load sensor: To measure weight.
    Microcontroller: Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
    Power supply: To power the system.

Additional:

    Computer or display unit: To monitor the system and log data.
